# GitHub Pages Deployment Guide

## Quick Setup (Recommended)

1. **Push your code to GitHub**:
   ```bash
   git add .
   git commit -m "Setup portfolio for GitHub Pages"
   git push origin main
   ```

2. **Enable GitHub Pages**:
   - Go to your repository on GitHub
   - Click on "Settings" tab
   - Scroll down to "Pages" section
   - Under "Source", select "GitHub Actions"
   - The workflow will automatically deploy your site

3. **Your site will be live at**:
   `https://yourusername.github.io/repository-name`

## What was Fixed

The original issue was that GitHub Pages couldn't serve the React app directly because:
1. React apps need to be built into static files
2. GitHub Pages was trying to serve source code instead of the built application

## Solutions Implemented

### 1. GitHub Actions Workflow
- **File**: `.github/workflows/deploy.yml`
- **Purpose**: Automatically builds and deploys the React app
- **Triggers**: On every push to main branch

### 2. Static Site Configuration
- **Package.json**: Added `"homepage": "."` for relative paths
- **404.html**: Added SPA routing support
- **Index.html**: Added client-side routing script

### 3. Self-Contained Components
- **Skills Component**: Modern grid layout with tech icons
- **Hero Component**: Fallback data for immediate deployment
- **About Component**: Static content without backend dependencies
- **Projects Component**: Uses mock data (already working)

## Alternative: Manual Build Deployment

If you prefer manual deployment:

```bash
# Build the project
cd frontend
yarn build

# The build/ folder contains your static files
# You can upload these files to any static hosting service
```

## Troubleshooting

### Site shows blank page:
- Check that GitHub Actions workflow completed successfully
- Ensure the repository is public (or you have GitHub Pro for private repos)

### CSS/JS not loading:
- Verify the `homepage` field in package.json is set to `"."`
- Check that all paths are relative, not absolute

### Routing issues:
- The 404.html file handles client-side routing
- Make sure it's present in the frontend/public/ directory

## Customization

### Update Portfolio Content:
1. **Personal Info**: Edit `frontend/src/components/Hero.jsx`
2. **About Section**: Edit `frontend/src/components/About.jsx`
3. **Skills**: Edit `frontend/src/components/Skills.jsx`
4. **Projects**: Edit `frontend/src/data/mock.js`

### Styling:
- Main theme colors are defined in `frontend/src/index.css`
- Uses Tailwind CSS with custom red accent color
- All components use consistent dark theme
